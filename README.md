# About Me  
34 years old. This is my first time in college, and I could not be more grateful for this opportunity. I work at Redeye Worldwide on the receiving team. We are a distribution warehouse for record labels.

## Interest  
I play guitar in a hardcore punk band called **Pollute.**  
I absolutely love being a band with my closest friends.  
Also, I collect vintage sci-fi books.
